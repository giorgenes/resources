## Temperature converter

Convert a temperature in K, C or F to the corresponding value in K, C or F.

Example:
Type the temperature unit (K, C, or F):
C
Type the temperature:
10
Convert to which unit?
F
Result: 10C is 50F

```
C to F = (C × 9/5)
C to K = C + 273.15
F to C = (F − 32) × 5/9
F to K = (F − 32) × 5/9 + 273.15
K to C = K − 273.15
K to F = (K − 273.15) × 9/5 + 32
```
